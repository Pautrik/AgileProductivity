Week 1:
what do I want to learn or understand better?
  : How to complete an entire project from scrath to finnished product. As well as develope my skills and toolset 
  when it comes to coding. It will also be of good use to learn how to develope something where value is determined by an
  external part completely. 
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  : First of all by being open and helping whenever people ask. Since we all have different backgrouds i think the people from IT will 
  be able to pick up allot of tips about value creatin and business models from me, and the rest of the people from I. 
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  : Overall: Staying positive, always being eager to start a new sprint. As well as developing a task list from user stories. 
  More specific, this week getting started, finding an external part to make sure we can start the process of creating. 
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  : This week my biggest contribution was finding an external part that wanted us to develop a software solution.
  
  
Week 2
What do I want to learn or understand better?
  :Pretty much same as last week, id like to complete an entire project from scratch and develop my toolset.
  What has emerged more this week is the design part, since we had to deliver a mockup of our first MVP.
  I’ve therefore realised that im quite interested in the UX and UI part of the project.
  Hence, I hope to learn more about that too. I think I will be able to pick up a lot of knowledge from my group 
  members during the project from IT since they have taken a few courses in the subject. 
  We have also decided to use react as a programming framework, 
  therefore I need to learn the basics. To do this I will look at a few tutorials during Easter and play around a bit. 
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  :By working together with group members from IT.
  I think we will be able to share knowledge. 
  Possibly I will be able to share knowledge about customer value and business models. 
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  :To help develop user stories and set up a scrum “environment” like Trello. To do this I will during
  Easter try to write a few user stories.
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  :For the past week it was creating the business model canvas.
  For easter I will keep in touch with our product owner to make sure we are on the right path developing our idea and making
  sure our mockup looks promising. As well as discussing future development plans.
