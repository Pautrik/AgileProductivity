Week 1:
what do I want to learn or understand better?
  : How to complete an entire project from scrath to finnished product. As well as develope my skills and toolset 
  when it comes to coding. It will also be of good use to learn how to develope something where value is determined by an
  external part completely. 
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  : First of all by being open and helping whenever people ask. Since we all have different backgrouds i think the people from IT will 
  be able to pick up allot of tips about value creatin and business models from me, and the rest of the people from I. 
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  : Overall: Staying positive, always being eager to start a new sprint. As well as developing a task list from user stories. 
  More specific, this week getting started, finding an external part to make sure we can start the process of creating. 
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  : This week my biggest contribution was finding an external part that wanted us to develop a software solution.
  
  
Week 2
What do I want to learn or understand better?
  :Pretty much same as last week, id like to complete an entire project from scratch and develop my toolset.
  What has emerged more this week is the design part, since we had to deliver a mockup of our first MVP.
  I’ve therefore realised that im quite interested in the UX and UI part of the project.
  Hence, I hope to learn more about that too. I think I will be able to pick up a lot of knowledge from my group 
  members during the project from IT since they have taken a few courses in the subject. 
  We have also decided to use react as a programming framework, 
  therefore I need to learn the basics. To do this I will look at a few tutorials during Easter and play around a bit. 
How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  :By working together with group members from IT.
  I think we will be able to share knowledge. 
  Possibly I will be able to share knowledge about customer value and business models. 
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
  :To help develop user stories and set up a scrum “environment” like Trello. To do this I will during
  Easter try to write a few user stories.
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
  :For the past week it was creating the business model canvas.
  For easter I will keep in touch with our product owner to make sure we are on the right path developing our idea and making
  sure our mockup looks promising. As well as discussing future development plans. 
  
  week 3 and 4 were skipped due to easter.
  
  Week 5
  What do I want to learn or understand better?
  
    :Right now im moderate at web developement, as well as wokring remote individually on software projects.
    Therefore, i really want to continue to get better at the React framework as well as HTML, javascript and css. I also need to
    get a better understanding of all the features of github and getting used to them. This will be essential for our
    distance cooperation to work well. To get better at these things i will continue to experiment with web developement tools
    as well as trying to use git as much as possible. I also make sure to use the assets in our team, since  a few of our teammates from IT 
    have allot more experience when it comes to using web developemenet i try to get as much information from them as possible. 
  
  How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
  
    : By coding peer to peer i think i can help with giving new views on things and how to solve problems.
      Since allot of the other mebmers also has to learn about web developemenet i share my new learned skills and revelations 
      with them, as well as sources and good tutorials to get knowledge about specific things.
      
  
  what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
    : Im keeping in touch with our product owner most of the time to make sure we are on the right path. 
     By doing this i can create user stories that are well suited for his needs. Besides  this i (as well as other mebmbers) make sure
     our sprint meetings are structured and moving foreward.
     I want to keep staying in close touch with our PO to make sure we do go towards a faulity direction. 
  
  what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
   : This week it has been to work with the frontend. Our entire frontend team has been writing code togehter to get a good
   and steady foundation. As well as to learn. 
   Next week i really want to start working on my own, to get more secure on my on coding skills and to get to try my 
   new gained knowledge regarding web developement and design.
