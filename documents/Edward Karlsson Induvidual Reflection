Week 1:

What do I want to learn or understand better?
I want to learn JavaScript and React in order to develop the front-end of the application.

How can I help someone, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As how it is now, many team members doesn't know how to use git, so I can help them understand and use git to work on the application.

What is my contribution towards the team's application of scrum?
Contributing with tasks for the things that needs to be done, and allways ensure that those tasks are done or that someone is doing them.


What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
Holding up my end since the workload is distributed among us within the given timeframe of the delivery.


Week 2:

What do I want to learn or understand better?
Same as last week but with more focus on how to complete the application that we are building. That means looking into and understanding
more of calendarlike applications and different features that they have.

How can I help someone, or the entire team, to learn something new?
The situation is the same as how it was last week, however we have agreed on that we will start to code after easter. This means
that my java knowledge is still usefull but everyone will studdy java, javasctipt and react on their own during easter. If I find
a good react tutorial on youtube for example I can share it with my team so they can take part of it.


What is my contribution towards the team's application of scrum?
We haven't yet started with user stories but we probably will the comming week, so my job is to ensure we use scrum for our tasks.

What is my contribution towards the team's deliveries?
Me and a team member made the mockup that had to be done until friday, which we did. We found a web page where we could work on the mockup together.
